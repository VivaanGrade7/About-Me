            Hello my name is <b>Vivaan, I am 12 years old.</b> 
            I study in The <u>Bombay International School.</u> 
            I am now in grade 7A.
            My favourite subject in school is PE as the class gives us the chance to take a break from all the differnt subjects.
            I also enjoy the break time where I can play football with my classmates.
            My favourite part about school is that we can meet friends and learn at the same time.
            I also go to school in bus 7 on the way and bus 4 on the way back. I am in Alpha house.   
        </p>
